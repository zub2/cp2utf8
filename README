What is it?
===========

cp2utf8 - a tool for converting 8-byte data into UTF8 based on translation
tables identical to those used by the linux kbd package. (See setfont(8)).


Why not to simply use iconv?
============================

For some unknown-to-me reason, iconv destroys most of the non-alphanumeric
characters. I needed a tool to convert pretty much everything that can be
represented in unicode into appropriate unicode characters (for example I
wanted to keep the "graphical" characters - those used for frames etc.).

The situation was similar with other tools. :-/

Still this program is generic enough to be usable for many charsets, as long
as you have the appropriate translation table (and it's not difficult to create
new tables, should you need something exotic).

I'm personally using this program together with DOSEMU, as part of a print
filter.


Compiling
=========

No autotools needed, just plain makefile. Nothing more than the standard C
runtime is needed, so compiling should be trivial. Just type 'make' and
that should be it.


Installing
==========

Apart from the standard C runtime it doesn't require anything else, so you can
put it anywhere...

If anybody finds it useful, enjoy! :-)


Licence
=======
