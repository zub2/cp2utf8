Description: Character set conversion utility.
 This program converts input from legacy 8bit encodings into UTF-8. It uses
 a .trans file (the same as these used by the package kbdtools).
 .
 The distinguishing features of this program are:
  * it's easy to create your own mapping table
  * all bytes (including control characters) are mapped
 .
 Included in the package are conversion tables for CP852 and CP895 aka.
 Kamenicky. Especially the latter one is exotic.
